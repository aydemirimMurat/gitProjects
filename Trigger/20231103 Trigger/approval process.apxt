An approval process is an automated process implemented to approve records in Salesforce. It specifies the steps necessary for approval, and allows a step to apply to all records or just records that have certain attributes. An automated process also specifies who does the approving at each step, and the actions to take when a record is approved, rejected, or recalled.
